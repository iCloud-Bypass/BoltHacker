Preliminary Bolt research:

Exploitation ideas:
  - website account hacking
      - shown with Josh that this is not a feasible route
  - Bluetooth sniffing
  - Wifi packet manipulation
    - External bridge provides entry point for exploitation (yet to test)
    - found that SMS attempts through bridge were not possible to spoof

BLE repeater attack idea:
  -the lock has an option for you to set the lock so that it unlocks automatically whenever you are away and then return to the lock
  -if we could make the lock think that the phone is returning home, maybe we could trick the lock into opening
  -idea: establish a long range bluetooth connection between the lock and phone so that they both think that they are right next to       each other
  -how to potentially do it: set up two bridges, one near the phone, and one near the lock. Each bridge captures the bluetooth sent out from one of the devices, sends its as a payload over a long range http or cellular connection to the other bridge, which then retranmits the bluetooth to the other device. Basically this is just building a giant bluetooth extender/repeater.
  -the phone thinks that its bridge is actually the lock, and the lock thinks that its bridge is actually the phone
  -these types of bridges exist but this attack would be difficult to implement.
  -reason it gets past the encryption is that we would literally take the encrypted packet sent out by the lock, and have the other bridge send that same encrypted packet to the phone, and vice versa.

Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE)
  - Sources
    - https://mbientlab.com/tutorials/AboutWireless.html#bluetooth-protocol

  - Bluetooth operates on 2.4 GHz ISM band (same as WiFi)
  - unlike traditional Bluetooth, BLE remains in sleep mode until a connection is initiatied

      Type  |      BLE      |     WiFi    |

    â€¢ Personal Thoughts
      - if we know the frequency at which these work we can better undertand how to sniff the signals
  
  - Platform Support
    - iOS5+ (iOS7+ preferred)
    - Android 4.3+ (numerous bug fixes in 4.4+)
    - Apple OS X 10.6+
    - Windows 8 (XP, Vista and 7 only support Bluetooth 2.1)
    - GNU/Linux Vanilla BlueZ 4.93+ 
  
  - Connection
    - Bluetooh peripheral can only connect to 1 master device
        - can have many other slave devices
  
  - GAP (Generic Access Protocol)
    - allows your device to be seen to the outside world
    - handles all connections and advertisments
      
  - Device Roles
    - Peripheral and Central devices
      - Central device has more processing power
      - Peripherals connects to central device
      
  - Advertising Data and Scan Response payloads
    - Both carry up to 31 bytes of data
    - only Advertising Data payload is necessary
      - peripherals contantly transmitting to central devices to let them know it exists
    - Scan Response payload
      - can be requested by central device at any point in advertising period
