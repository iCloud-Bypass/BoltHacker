Going to have to figure out how to set this lock up. Let's get to it!

Download app on iPhone from app store

Currently setup under Joshua Stern's account. Username: joshuastern72@gmail.com  

Put in batteries into lock and use app to search for lock.

Installed and tested and working properly.

I am able to share access to the lock with Zack who also downloaded the app, and he is able to lock and unlock the lock. I can set time limits for him and revoke access whenever I want to.
