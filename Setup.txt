Going to have to figure out how to set this lock up. Let's get to it!

Download app on iPhone from app store

Currently setup under Joshua Stern's account. Username: joshuastern72@gmail.com  

Put in batteries into lock and use app to search for lock.

Installed and tested and working properly.

I am able to share access to the lock with Zack who also downloaded the app, and he is able to lock and unlock the lock. I can set time limits for him and revoke access whenever I want to.

We have also purchased the bridge which we have paired to the Wifi. This is letting us control the lock over wifi if we are not within ble range. I am not sure if the bridge can communicate with my phone. It connects to the Lockitron server, and we can access it on their website.
